# hand-danger-poc

This project detects a user’s hand in real time using computer vision and tracks how close it is to a virtual boundary on the screen. The system uses a webcam and color segmentation to locate the hand, calculates the distance to a predefined danger zone, and displays feedback as SAFE, WARNING, or DANGER. When the hand reaches the boundary, the system triggers a clear on-screen alert saying “DANGER DANGER.”
